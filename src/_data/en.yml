      desc: "Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning which is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. Many of these concepts and methods are older than computers themselves. Nevertheless, only recently, Deep Learning made its way into regular industry and revolutionized it. Let's take a closer look on the Deep Learning history and the way it changed the way we perceive business, machines and computers. Then, let's understand how open-source enabled the revolution to happen and how can it make Poland a Deep Learning hub for next generations of computer scientists."

      desc: "<p>Goal: Creating a Bitcoin trading box with fully automatic algorithms in a secure hardware environment. Bitcoin has become quite popular as the first and currently most valuable crypto currency. The ‘buy early and hold’ strategy has been mostly successful in the past for gaining revenue. However, due to the volatility of the exchange rates, active trading may be tempting to yield quicker and higher return of investment. Unfortunately, manual trading can be like irresponsible gambling for the unexperienced user, and may result in quickly destroying all of your Bit- coins or Euros investments. The Information Management Master course ‘Make Money Fast Box’ project aims to im- plement a pure algorithmic trading in a way that keeps the user from making bad trading decisions caused by greed or panic, and at the same time acts as an electronic version of a blockchain-based savings account, also eliminating an attac vector by providing specific hardware as storage for the wallet.</p>"

      desc: "<p>On the server market, more and more frequently we can find machines based on ARM architecture. Although they are still in the minority compared to the competition, their numbers maintain an upward trend. It is worth to take a closer look at the ARM architecture and get to know the hardware capabilities. In the field of virtualization, ARM servers cannot stand apart from the well known x86_64 architecture, which is why over the last few years we've had several significant extensions aimed at this purpose. In my presentation I would like to introduce the ARMv8 architecture and methods of CPU and peripheral devices virtualization on the example of KVM. I will also discuss optimization methods that may be useful when managing virtual machines.

Have you ever run a compilation process for whole Linux distribution by your own, not just kernel or single package? I'm going to present the possibilities of those Embedded Linux build systems, as well as some benchmarks and comparison. </p><p>For example: What is the time and cost of a full compilation process on various cloud instances? How much space do we need on the host system and how small images of the target system can we get? With a little bit of live coding, I will also present how create a Docker base images using output of mentioned distribution builders. This idea seems to fit perfectly with the current edge computing trends.</p>"
